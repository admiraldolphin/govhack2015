The Question Time server is written in Go, a language created and used by Google for its own server software. Go is designed to be easy-to-learn and Go programs are highly readable, yet Go is powerful and builds programs quickly. Go has first-class concurrency primitives based on C.A.R. Hoare's Communicating Sequential Processes, which improves comprehensibility of concurrent behaviour, and encourages writing programs with many concurrent components. Go also includes a broad, powerful, and extensible standard library, implementing many modern technologies in Go such as HTTP/2 and TLS (rather than linking external libraries). Question Time Server can run many  games concurrently, bounded only by available system resources and horizontally-scalable to multiple servers, correctly synchronizing state between player connections.
