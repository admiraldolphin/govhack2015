#Question Time!

Question Time is a competitive two player trivia game around members of the house of representatives made by Team Executive Swivel for Govhack AU 2015.

Both players pick a representative and a portfolio and are asked a series of policy questions you have to answer the same way as your chosen member.

At the end of the game you are given a summary of how you went against your opponent.

##Running it
If you want to run the game yourself there are a couple of things to know, the game is broken up into a client and a server.

###The Server
To run the server you need to install Go, afterwards the run.sh file inside the project will take care of the rest

###The Client
The client is an iPad app, so you'll need Xcode and a development license, the QuestionTime Xcode project will take care of the rest.
Once you've got the client installed and the server running, you can set where the client searches for the server inside the applications settings inside the iPad's settings app
